else spend more time scrolling than they do watching?, Hello. It\\'s me, the busy man., The busy job man with the wife and two young kids man.

Puts way too much butter on his crackers\\xa0man. Ignores that terrifying, evolving pile of unfolded laundry man. , Just survived my 6 year old\\'s birthday party. Don\\'t tell me I don\\'t deserve this. pic.twitter.com/a8OaNaifU9, The finally sits down to watch TV at 9 p.m. man. , It\\'s the year 2021. We\\'re currently floating adrift in the \"bad\" timeline. In this world, everything is either melting or freezing. In my country, Australia, we\\'re in the midst of a never ending COVID lockdown and we have no idea when or how it\\'ll \\xa0In this dimension, in this universe, even the act of \"relaxing\" or \"sitting down to unwind\" fills me with an existential, dull, aching dread. , It\\'s an all-too-familiar process. I push the on button on my OLED TV. The TV I painstakingly calibrated according to very specific settings. The TV I eventually purchased on sale after painstakingly reading through reviews and buyers\\' guides online. Everything I do is \"painstaking\"., I hit the little Netflix button on my remote and scroll., And I scroll., And I scrolllllllllllllllllllllllll., Research suggests the average person scrolls streaming services for 19 minutes before deciding what show to watch. That\\'s me on my best day. This may be the result of a neurotic personality defect. The kind that has me obsessing over black levels on overpriced TVs, but I have -- on many occasions, more than I care to count -- sat down to watch television on Netflix and literally scrolled for hours before going to bed having watched nothing. , Or maybe I\\'ll start a new show or documentary or movie, watch it for 10 minutes and decide no, I chose poorly. This is not worth my constantly ebbing timeâ€¦, Back to the scroll., To the endless scroll. To the making of lists. \"This show isn\\'t worthwhile now, but maybe in another timeline, in another universe, I will decide to watch this show. \"But no, not right now.\", I hover. Quickly grab my phone. A Google search. What did this do on Metacritic? Hmmmâ€¦ what about IMDb? Is this the show everyone was talking about on Twitter? Should I watch it? Do I need to be across this? , Do I need to have an opinion on this? To be equipped for discussions at a party or on Slack. Are people going to ask me about this show? About the latest documentary series?\\xa0, Am I obliged to watch these shows?\\xa0, Why do I feel obliged to watch this show? What is this strange, claustrophobic pressure on my chest as I hover; Invisible algorithms slowly wrapping round my throat. No Netflix, I don\\'t want to watch bloody Clickbait, so stop asking me., If I was of sounder mind, I might turn off the TV, do some yoga, meditate. I don\\'t know. Instead, I continue scrolling endlessly until the heat death of the universe.\\xa0, Normal. Completely normal., Me staring vacantly into the void of never-ending TV choices., Back to the scroll. Or maybe a sneaky switch to Amazon Prime. To a whole new set of shows. To a brand new user interface. To\\xa0whatever else is new on that service. To a whole new set of movies, most of which were on Netflix last month. An endless game of catch. An endless multi-brand scroll that spans oceans and services.\\xa0, Right, right, right, right. , Down., Right, right, right, right., Hover., Pick up phone. Google., Put phone down. , Right, right, right., This is my time. My precious, limited free time. A contradiction so acute it bends space, time and reason: the pressure to make the absolute best use of this precious limited free time is making me waste that time with an incredible, crushing efficiency.\\xa0, Is it the sheer volume? The sea of garbage? The fact that services once loaded with high-quality flagship shows are trending toward mediocrity? Is it the pressure? The endless social media vortex that swallows all matter and light? Are our attention spans so battered and bruised we can\\'t even convince our frazzled neurons to fire in the right direction?, All I know is the laundry remains unfolded. The dishes await scrubbing. It\\'s now 10 p.m. and my kids wake up at 6. If I watch a movie now I might get five hours of sleep before the doom cycle begins anew. But which movie? I can only watch one and there are so many. I have to watch the best one. The good one. The one I am duty bound to watch as the universe collapses on itself., Right, right, right., Down., Right, right, right, right. , \"No, not that one. I\\'ll add it to my list.\", Out of Amazon. Back to Netflix. One more quick google. More scrolling. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling., Another quick glance at my phone. It\\'s 10:30 pm. I am so, so tired. , I am the tired man., Maybe I should just go to bed..., Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read.

our Arlo Essential Video Doorbell review Testing to determine the best video doorbell is similar to testing any other home security camera First I download the corresponding app and create an account if I do already have one While a lot of products include tutorial booklets in the box with your purchase I prefer to start with the app A good app includes detailed steps on the installation process as well as how to connect to your network and actually get the smart device up and running It your shop for taking your doorbell setup from start to finish Make sure the doorbell is installed based on the manufacturer specifications either hardwired doorbell or or As soon as it connected and I able to view the live video feed I check the settings I make sure features like motion detection or activity zones are enabled they are always turned on by default to get a complete sense of what it like to use the product and to see how well the device actually works as a replacement to a regular nonsmart doorbell Does it work with smart home platforms If so do the smart features work well together Nowadays a smart home device is expected to work with at least one major smart home platform Amazon Alexa Google Assistant and Apple HomeKit are the main ones you need to look for How the latency If your smart doorbell camera takes a long time to send a push notification after someone rings your doorbell then you risk missing your visitor completely You also need to be sure you getting notifications when something sets of the motion detector as you can set the motion sensor of most video doorbells to notify you of activity happening near your door even if no one rings the you have latency problems start with your connection If it is strong where the doorbell is installed you might consider moving it or more easily getting a range extender But it could also be the way the software How the live view Doorbells are often exposed to direct sunlight but many others are installed under porches near shady trees and in all sorts of other settings It important that the camera has night vision and can handle any of these scenarios so you do get stuck with a nonfunctioning product that ca see faces under a porch How the audio If the doorbell microphone and speaker do work well you going to have a tough time communicating with whoever there I test this out multiple times to see how the doorbell audio sounds over my phone Be respectful keep it civil and stay on topic We delete comments that violate our policy which we encourage you to read Discussion threads can be closed at
